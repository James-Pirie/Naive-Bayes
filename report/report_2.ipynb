    "## Data Representation and Pre-Processing\n",
    "For how words are represneted, I decided it would be best to count frequency, rather than purely a binary exists or does not exist. I believe that frequency would allow me to get a lot more information from the data. To store the frequency in my program, originaly I calculated the vocabulary, then the probability per class, then the bayes score for every word, then stored that so I could preform processess, but in practice this was a very slow method and took about 40 minutes simply to pre-processe. I then decided on a new method, first, the vocabulary would be retrieved, then I would generate a dictionary, the keys in the dictionary would be each word in the vocabulary, then each key would have another dict with the keys being every unique class. Each key would associate with the number of times the word appears in each class."

    "## Naive Bayes Implementation\n",
    "My implementation first gets all the classes, it then calculates the probability of one class existing based on the proportion it makes up in the data set, n of class rows / total rows. The get_word_score method takes in a word and uses the bayes formula count(w|c) / len(documents of class(c)). Then predict_abstract_class iterates over all words in an abstract using the get_word_score n of words in abstract times for every class in the dataframe. Multiplying the scores together and with the class probability using the logarithm method to avoid underflow, then whichever value for each class is bigger is the prediciton."

    "## Naive Bayes Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "### N-Grams\n",
    "My first attemp at Naive Bayes extension was with N-Grams. Instead of calculating the vocabulary with each word being a token, I wrote a method to group n words together for every combination found in the data-set. When performing bayes on these the accuracy actually decreased from about 94% on basic naive bayes to about 92%, if n=2. If n was equal to anything else accuracy would drop to less than 60%, which is not ideal. I did not end up keeping Naive Bayes in my final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Over Sampling\n",
    "My secocond attempt cat Naive Bayes extension was by improving the IID of the data-set by oversampling minority classes. To help me with this I imported RandomOverSampler from the imblearn library. I then created a function called over_sample, it takes in a dataframe and splits it into two parts, one with just the abstract and one for the target variable. It then uses RandomOverSampler fit_resample to fit the features to assciated classes to balance it so that there are equal amounts of all 4 classes. Returning as a reconstructed data frame. This method was quite succesful and score around 98% accuracy on my validation, which is explained later, and 98% on Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stop Word Removal\n",
    "My third extension I implemented was stop word removal. Stop words are words suchs as \"the\" or \"and\", which often don't provide actual information to the bayes classifier, and might mislead it. To achieve this, first I downloaded a file from nltk which contains a large amount of stop words for the English language. I then wrote a method called remove_stop_words, which takes in a string, splits it by blank space and then iterates through it, saving the word only if it is not in the stop words file. For internal testing and validation this did not make much of a difference, but on submission to Kaggle accuracy increased by .3%, so I kept it in my final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Noteable Attempts\n",
    "- Before Oversampling I attempted to manualy weight classes by adjusting multiplications of class probabilities, this method was less succesful and very prone to optimisation bias, so was not kept.\n",
    "- I also attempted to weight words by summing their frequencyies from the dictionary and the lower the frequency the higher the weighting, this decreased accuracy so was not kept."

    "## Validation \n",
    "### Method\n",
    "- For validation I primarily used the accuracy score. Accuracy is measured by number of correctly classified rows divided by total number of rows multiplied by 100, given as a percentage. This is calculate in the method test_training, which takes in two data frames, training data and testing data, it then takes in a dictionary as described above in data-representation and another dictionary which contains pre-processed calculated values for the numnber of total words in each class. The accuracy is then calculated then returned as a fstring: f\"Accuracy: {accuracy}%\".\n",
    "- To ensure the best validation I also used k-fold cross validation. I wrote a method called k_fold_cross_validation, which takes in the k, in this case I used 10, and the data as a data frame. The data frame is then split into k equal pieces, and then k times k - 1 splits of the data are concatonated to be used for training, which involves calculating the word_count_dict and number_of_word_per_class_dict dictionary, then test_training is run k times with the testing data being the left over k slice, not used in training.\n",
    "### Resutls\n",
    "My extended Naive Bayes model scored between 3 and 5% better on average, getting about 98-99% accuracy on my k-fold testing, and 97.6% accuracy on kaggle. This compared to the original Naive Bayes which scored 91% on Kaggle and about 92-94% on k-fold. These results are shown at the bottom of this document. This clearly shows that my extensions are an improvemnt over base Naive Bayes and, as shown by the K-fold cross validation, quite significant, nearing 99%."
